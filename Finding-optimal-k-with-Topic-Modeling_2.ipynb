      "The sound effects were among the last things added to the game, created by Toshio Kai.\n",
      "The biggest of these was the game's title; executives at Namco were worried that vandals would change the \"P\" in Puck Man to an \"F\", forming an obscene name.\n",

Yee received a letter from United States president Ronald Reagan congratulating him on a world record score of 6,131,940 points, possible only if he had passed level 256.\n",

      "In 1999, Billy Mitchell offered $100,000 to anyone who could pass level 256 before January 1, 2000.\n",
      "The offer expired with the prize unclaimed.After announcing in 2018 that it would no longer recognize the first perfect score on Pac-Man, Guinness World Records reversed that decision and reinstated Billy Mitchell's 1999 performance on June 18, 2020.Pac-Man inspired a long series of sequels, remakes, and re-imaginings, and is one of the longest-running video game franchises in history.\n",
      "The first of these was Ms. Pac-Man, developed by the American-based General Computer Corporation and published by Midway in 1982.\n",
      "Midway produced many other Pac-Man sequels during the early 1980s, including Pac-Man Plus (1982), Jr. Pac-Man (1983), Baby Pac-Man (1983), and Professor Pac-Man (1984).\n",

      "If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he loses a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.\n",
      "Each of the four ghosts has its own unique artificial intelligence (A.I.), or \"personality\": Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde switches between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.Placed near the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\" or \"power pellets.\"\n",
      "Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, its eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost \"regenerates\" and resumes its normal activity.\n",
      "Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value.\n",
      "Upon completion, the game was titled Puck Man, based on the working title and the titular character's distinct hockey puck-like shape.Location testing for Puck Man began on May 22, 1980, in Shibuya, Tokyo, to a relatively positive fanfare from players.\n",
      "In Europe, the game was released under both titles, Pac-Man and Puck Man.When Namco presented Pac-Man and Rally-X to potential distributors at the 1980 AMOA tradeshow in November, executives believed that Rally-X would be the best-selling game of that year.\n",

      "Namco had initially approached Atari to distribute Pac-Man, but Atari refused the offer.\n",
      "Midway Manufacturing subsequently agreed to distribute both Pac-Man and Rally-X in North America, announcing their acquisition of the manufacturing rights on November 22 and releasing them in December.Pac-Man was ported to a plethora of home video game systems and personal computers; the most infamous of these is the 1982 Atari 2600 conversion, designed by Tod Frye and published by Atari.\n",
      "Alongside the Xbox 360 remake Pac-Man Championship Edition, it was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2012 as part of Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions.\n",

      "Within one year, more than 100,000 arcade units had been sold which grossed more than $1 billion in quarters.\n",
      "The two ghost pieces were randomly packed with one of four colors.Sticker manufacturer Fleer included rub-off game cards with its Pac-Man stickers.\n",
      "Namco's own follow-up to the original was Super Pac-Man, released in 1982.\n",
      "Nelsonic Industries produced a Pac-Man LCD wristwatch game with a simplified maze also in 1982.Namco Networks sold a downloadable Windows PC version of Pac-Man in 2009 which also includes an enhanced mode which replaces all of the original sprites with the sprites from Pac-Man Championship Edition.\n",
      "Namco Networks made a downloadable bundle which includes its PC version of Pac-Man and its port of Dig Dug called Namco All-Stars: Pac-Man and Dig Dug.\n",
      "The Google Doodle version of Pac-Man was estimated to have been played by more than 1 billion people worldwide in 2010, so Google later gave the game its own page.In April 2011, Soap Creative published World's Biggest Pac-Man, working together with Microsoft and Namco-Bandai to celebrate Pac-Man's 30th anniversary.\n",
      "There were two custom chips on the board: the 285 sync bus controller and the 284 video RAM addresser, but daughterboards made only from standard parts were also widely used instead.\n",
      "Video output was (analog) component video with composite sync.\n",
      "A further 8 kbyte of character ROM was used for characters, background tiles and sprites and an additional 1 kbit of static RAM was used to hold 4bpp sprite data for one scanline and was written to during the horizontal blanking period preceding each line.\n",
      "Although attribute memory exists for them, sprites 0 and 7 are unusable: Their pixel fetch timing windows are occupied by the bottom level indicator (which just precedes the hblank) for sprite 0 and two rows of characters at the top of the screen, which just follow the hblank, for sprite 7.\n",

      "Company president Masaya Nakamura created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several NEC-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.\n",
      "The idea for energizers was a concept Iwatani borrowed from Popeye the Sailor, a cartoon character that temporarily acquires superhuman strength after eating a can of spinach; it is also believed that Iwatani was also partly inspired by a Japanese children's story about a creature that protected children from monsters by devouring them.\n",
      "Frank Fogleman, the co-founder of Gremlin Industries, believes that the maze-chase gameplay of Pac-Man was inspired by Sega's Head On (1979), a similar arcade game that was popular in Japan.Iwatani has often claimed that the character of Pac-Man himself was designed after the shape of a pizza with a missing slice while he was at lunch; in a 1986 interview he said that this was only half-truth, and that the Pac-Man character was also based on him rounding out and simplifying the Japanese character \"kuchi\" (口), meaning \"mouth\".\n",
      "The four ghosts were made to be cute, colorful and appealing, using bright, pastel colors and expressive blue eyes.\n",
      "Iwatani had used this idea before in Cutie Q, which features similar ghost-like characters, and decided to incorporate it into Pac-Man.\n",
      "He was also inspired by the television series Casper the Friendly Ghost and the manga Obake no Q-Taro.\n",
      "Iwatani believed that the ghosts should be different colors, and he received unanimous support from his colleagues for this idea.\n",
      "The ghosts were programmed to have their own distinct personalities, so as to keep the game from becoming too boring or impossibly difficult to play.\n",
      "(The ghosts' Japanese names are おいかけ, chase; まちぶせ, ambush; きまぐれ, fickle; and おとぼけ, playing dumb, respectively.)\n",
      "To break up the tension of constantly being pursued, humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and Blinky were added.\n",
      "The Famicom version was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1990 as a budget title for the Disk Writer kiosks in retail stores.\n",
