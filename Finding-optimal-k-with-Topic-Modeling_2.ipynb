      "Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item usually in the form of a fruit to appear underneath the center box; the item can be eaten for bonus points.\n",
      "The idea for energizers was a concept Iwatani borrowed from Popeye the Sailor, a cartoon character that temporarily acquires superhuman strength after eating a can of spinach; it is also believed that Iwatani was also partly inspired by a Japanese children's story about a creature that protected children from monsters by devouring them.\n",
      "Frank Fogleman, the co-founder of Gremlin Industries, believes that the maze-chase gameplay of Pac-Man was inspired by Sega's Head On 1979, a similar arcade game that was popular in Japan.Iwatani has often claimed that the character of Pac-Man himself was designed after the shape of a pizza with a missing slice while he was at lunch; in a 1986 interview he said that this was only half-truth, and that the Pac-Man character was also based on him rounding out and simplifying the Japanese character \"kuchi\" , meaning \"mouth\".\n",
      "The four ghosts were made to be cute, colorful and appealing, using bright, pastel colors and expressive blue eyes.\n",
      "Iwatani had used this idea before in Cutie Q, which features similar ghost-like characters, and decided to incorporate it into Pac-Man.\n",
      "Each of the ghosts were programmed to have their own distinct personalities, so as to keep the game from becoming too boring or impossibly difficult to play.\n",
      "Each ghost's name gives a hint to its strategy for tracking down Pac-Man: Shadow \"Blinky\" always chases Pac-Man, Speedy \"Pinky\" tries to get ahead of him, Bashful \"Inky\" uses a more complicated strategy to zero in on him, and Pokey \"Clyde\" alternates between chasing him and running away.\n",
      "Masaya Nakamura chose to rename it to Pac-Man, as he felt it was closer to the game's original Japanese title of Pakkuman.\n",
      "A port for the Atari 5200 was released in 1983, a version that many have seen as a significant improvement over the Atari 2600 version.Namco released a version for the Family Computer in 1984 as one of the console's first third-party titles, as well as a port for the MSX computer.\n",
      "The same year, Namco released a port of Pac-Man for the Game Boy, which allowed for two-player co-operative play via the Game Link Cable peripheral.\n",
      "A version for the Game Gear was released a year later, which also enabled support for multiplayer.\n",
      "In celebration of the game's 20th anniversary in 1999, Namco re-released the Game Boy version for the Game Boy Color, bundled with Pac-Attack and titled Pac-Man: Special Color Edition.\n",
      "The same year, Namco and SNK co-published a port for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which came with a circular \"Cross Ring\" that attached to the d-pad to restrict it to four-directional movement.In 2001, Namco released a port of Pac-Man for various Japanese mobile phones, being one of the company's first mobile game releases.\n",
      "The Famicom version of the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini series, released to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Famicom; this version was also released in North America and Europe under the Classic NES Series label.\n",
      "Namco released the game in the third volume of Namco History in Japan in 1998.\n",
      "In 2014, Pac-Man was included in the compilation title Pac-Man Museum for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, alongside several other Pac-Man games.\n",
      "The NES version is one of 30 games included in the NES Classic Edition.Upon its North American debut at AMOA 1980, the game initially received a mild response.\n",
      "On August 21, 2016, in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, during a video which showcases Tokyo as the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics, a small segment shows Pac-Man and the ghosts racing and eating dots on a running track.A wide variety of Pac-Man merchandise have been marketed with the character's image.\n",
      "In 2023, 7-Eleven included Pac-Man in its Spring 2023 marketing material including at Speedway and Stripes banner locations, and sold more merchandise around the game as well as rebranding some of its products after the ghosts.\n",

      "When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level.\n",
      "In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations.\n",
      "If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.\n",
      "Each of the four ghosts has their own unique artificial intelligence A.I., or \"personality\": Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.Placed near the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\" or \"power pellets.\"\n",
      "Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost \"regenerates\" and resumes their normal activity.\n",
      "Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value.\n",
      "Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.\n",
      "His game was initially called Pakkuman, based on the Japanese onomatopoeia term \"paku paku taberu\", referencing the mouth movement of opening and closing in succession.The game that later became Pac-Man began development in early 1979 and took a year and five months to complete, the longest ever for a video game up to that point.\n",
      "The sound effects were among the last things added to the game, created by Toshio Kai.\n",
      "In a design session, Iwatani noisily ate fruit and made gurgling noises to describe to Kai how he wanted the eating effect to sound.\n",
