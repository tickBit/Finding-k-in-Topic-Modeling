      " In a design session, Iwatani noisily ate fruit and made gurgling noises to describe to Kai how he wanted the eating effect to sound.\n",
      " This version of the game was widely criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of the arcade version and for its peculiar design choices, most notably the flickering effect of the ghosts.\n",
      " In celebration of the game 's 20th anniversary in 1999, Namco re- released the Game Boy version for the Game Boy Color, bundled with Pac- Attack and titled Pac- Man: Special Color Edition.\n",
      " A Roku version was released in 2011, alongside a port of the Game Boy release for the 3DS Virtual Console.\n",
      " Munchkin!\n",
      " On June 3, 2010, at the NLGD Festival of Games, the game 's creator, Toru Iwatani, officially received the certificate from Guinness World Records for Pac- Man having had the most `` coin- operated arcade machines `` installed worldwide: 293,822.\n",
      " 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and received a Gold certification for more than 1 million records sold by 1982, and a total of 2.5 million copies sold as of 2008.\n",
      "=== TOPIC 2 ===\n",
      " Each of the four ghosts has their own unique artificial intelligence A.I., or `` personality ``: Blinky gives direct chase to Pac- Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac- Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac- Man and fleeing from him. Placed at the four corners of the maze are large flashing `` energizers `` or `` power pellets. ``\n",
      " The game established the maze chase game genre, was the first video game to make use of power- ups, and the individual ghosts have deterministic artificial intelligence AI that reacts to player actions.\n",
      " Pac- Man is considered one of the first video games to have demonstrated the potential of characters in the medium; its title character was the first original gaming mascot, it increased the appeal of video games with female audiences, and it was gaming 's first broad licensing success.\n",
      " `` Maze chase `` games exploded on home computers after the release of Pac- Man.\n",
      " Some of them appeared before official ports and garnered more attention from consumers, and sometimes lawyers, as a result.\n",
      " Many post- Pac- Man titles include power- ups that briefly turn the tables on the enemy.\n",
      " The Pac- Man character and game series became an icon of video game culture during the 1980s.\n",
      " Of those 1 kbyte each was for video ram, color ram and generic program ram.\n",
      "=== TOPIC 3 ===\n",
      " Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen.\n",
      " In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac- Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations.\n",
      " Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and to reverse direction.\n",
      " Pac- Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost `` regenerates `` and resumes their normal activity.\n",
      " Due to an integer overflow, the 256th level loads improperly, rendering it impossible to complete. After acquiring the struggling Japanese division of Atari in 1974, video game developer Namco began producing its own video games in- house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.\n",
      " Upon completion, the game was titled Puck Man, based on the working title and the titular character 's distinct hockey puck- like shape. Location testing for Puck Man began on May 22, 1980 in Shibuya, Tokyo, to a relatively positive fanfare from players.\n",
      " A private showing for the game was done in June, followed by a nationwide release in July.\n",
      " Eyeing the game 's success in Japan, Namco initialized plans to bring the game to the international market, particularly the United States.\n",
      " Atari also released versions for the Intellivision, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Apple II, IBM PC, TI-994A, ZX Spectrum, and the Atari 8- bit family of computers.\n",
      " The Famicom version of the game was re- released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the Famicom Mini series, released to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Famicom; this version was also released in North America and Europe under the Classic NES Series label.\n",
      " In 2021, according to Nintendo Direct, it was announced that Hamster Corporation would release Pac- Man, along with Xevious, for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of their Arcade Archives series, marking the first two Namco games to be included as part of the series.\n",
      " Namco released the game in the third volume of Namco History in Japan in 1998.\n",
      " Pac- Man 2: The New Adventures 1993 and Pac- Man World 2 2002 have Pac- Man as an unlockable extra.\n",
      " They said there 's `` more to the game than at first appears `` but criticized the sound as a drawback, saying it 's `` good for awhile, then becomes annoying. ``\n",
      " Pac- Man eventually became very successful in Japan, where it went on to be Japan 's highest- grossing arcade game of 1980 according to the annual Game Machine charts, dethroning Space Invaders 1978 which had topped the annual charts for two years in a row and leading to a shift in the Japanese market away from space shooters towards action games featuring comical characters.\n",
      " On July 20, 2020, Gorillaz and ScHoolboy Q, released a track entitled `` PAC- MAN `` as a part of Gorillaz' Song Machine series to commemorate the game 's 40th anniversary, with the music video depicting the band 's frontman, 2- D, playing a Gorillaz- themed Pac- Man arcade game. The Pac- Man character appears in the film Pixels 2015, with Denis Akiyama playing series creator Toru Iwatani.\n",
      " Legal concerns raised over who owned the game caused Ms. Pac- Man to become owned by Namco, who assisted in production of the game.\n",
      " A futher 8 kbyte of character rom was used for characters, background tiles and sprites and an additional 1 kbit of static ram was used to hold 4bpp sprite data for one scanline and was written to during the horizontal blanking period preceeding each line.\n",
      " Sprite size was always 16x16 pixels, one of the 4 colors per pixel was for transparency of the background.\n",
      "=== TOPIC 4 ===\n",
      " If Pac- Man is caught by a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.\n",
      " Masaya Nakamura chose to rename it to Pac- Man, as he felt it was closer to the game 's original Japanese title of Pakkuman.\n",
      " According to Play Meter magazine, both Pac- Man and Rally- X received mild attention at the show.\n",
      " 2, and the video game, Marvel 's Guardians of the Galaxy.\n",
      " The game, the character, and the ghosts all also appear in the film Wreck- It Ralph, as well as the sequel Ralph Breaks the Internet.\n",
      " In the Japanese tokusatsu film Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac- Man vs. Ex- Aid Ghost with Legend Riders, a Pac- Man- like character is the main villain. The 2018 film Relaxer uses Pac- Man as a strong plot element in the story of a 1999 couch- bound man who attempts to beat the game and encounters the famous Level 256 glitch before the year 2000 problem occurs. Pac- Man is referenced in a 2018 Black Mirror interactive film called Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.\n",
      " The conspiracy is that choice and free will is an illusion.\n",
      " Video output was analog component video with composite sync.\n",
      "=== TOPIC 5 ===\n",
      " Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.\n",
      " Frank Fogleman, the co- founder of Gremlin Industries, believes that the maze- chase gameplay of Pac- Man was inspired by Sega 's Head On 1979, a similar arcade game that was popular in Japan. Iwatani has often claimed that the character of Pac- Man himself was designed after the shape of a pizza with a missing slice while he was at lunch; in a 1986 interview he said that this was only half- truth, and that the Pac- Man character was also based on him rounding out and simplifying the Japanese character kuchi, meaning mouth.\n",
